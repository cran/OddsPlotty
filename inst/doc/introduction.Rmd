This package has been created to create odds plot for the results of a logistic regression. 

The package uses caret to train the model and the final model parameter is used to generate the application.


## Loading OddsPlotty

To use the odds_plot function you can invoke it by using:

```{r inv_odds_plot}
library(OddsPlotty)

```

## Training a GLM to use with odds plot

First we load the required packages. The example dataset we are going to use to work with OddsPlotty is the breast cancer data:

```{r load_pack}
#install.packages("mlbench")
#install.packages("caret")
library(mlbench)
library(caret)
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)
library(OddsPlotty)
library(e1071)
library(ggthemes)

```
Then we are going to load the data we need for the breast cancer data:

```{r data}
data("BreastCancer", package = "mlbench")
#Use complete cases of breast cancer
breast <- BreastCancer[complete.cases(BreastCancer), ] #Create a copy
breast <- breast[, -1]
head(breast, 10)
#Convert the class to a factor - Beningn (0) and Malignant (1)
breast$Class <- factor(breast$Class)
str(breast)

```

This takes care of the class encoding but now we need to code the factors to numeric

```{r data_loop}
for(i in 1:9) {
  breast[, i] <- as.numeric(as.character(breast[, i]))
}
#Loops through the first columns - 1 to 9 and changes them from factors to a numerical representation
str(breast)

```

This has now changed the data into a numerical value and this can now be used in the GLM model. 

## Training the GLM using Caret

I will use Caret to train the Generalised Linear Model (GLM) aka Logistic Regression, as this is the package that best supports the odds plot statistics. Please note: I am training on the full dataset and not undertaking a data partitioning method, as perhaps seen in logistic regression.

```{r train_glm}
library(caret)
glm_model <- train(Class ~ .,
                   data = breast,
                   method = "glm",
                   family = "binomial")

```
Once the model is trained we can inspect the results with OddsPlotty:

## Visualise with OddsPlotty

The below shows how to visualise and expose the plot from the saved list in OddsPlotty. 

```{r odds_plot, echo = FALSE}
plotty <- OddsPlotty::odds_plot(glm_model$finalModel,
                      title = "Odds Plot",
                      subtitle = "Showing odds of cancer based on various factors")


plotty$odds_plot
```



## Exposing the data frame

Each odds plot has an associated tibble under the hood for querying. To access the tibble use:

```{r oddstibble, echo = FALSE}
plotty$odds_data
```

## Using different themes with additional parameters

Additional parameters for the plot can be fed in:

```{r odds_plot_two, echo = FALSE}
library(OddsPlotty)
library(ggthemes)
plotty <- OddsPlotty::odds_plot(glm_model$finalModel, 
                      title = "Odds Plot with ggthemes economist",
                      subtitle = "Showing odds of cancer based on various factors",
                      point_col = "#00f2ff",
                      error_bar_colour = "black",
                      point_size = .5,
                      error_bar_width = .8,
                      h_line_color = "red") 

plot <- plotty$odds_plot 
plot <- plot + ggthemes::theme_economist() + theme(legend.position = "NULL")

# Add odds ratios to labels by calling the data list element
# The round function is used to return 2 decimal place values
plot + geom_text(label=round(plotty$odds_plot$data$OR, digits=2), 
                             hjust=0.1, vjust=2)

```

Another example of how to use a different theme:

```{r themes}
library(OddsPlotty)
library(ggthemes)
plotty <- OddsPlotty::odds_plot(glm_model$finalModel, 
                      title = "Odds Plot with ggthemes Tufte Theme",
                      subtitle = "Showing odds of cancer based on various factors",
                      point_col = "#00f2ff",
                      error_bar_colour = "black",
                      point_size = .5,
                      error_bar_width = .8,
                      h_line_color = "red")

plotty$odds_plot + ggthemes::theme_tufte()

```
